<ol type="1">
<li>Read the rules in SRD linked to on sidebar or buy Players Handbook and Dungeon Masters Guide from Wizards of the Coast</li>
<li>Buy dice for game. You will need at a minimum twenty-sided die(d20), a twelve-sided die(D12), a D10, D6 and D4. These can be bought online or at 
any friendly gaming shop.</li> 
<li>Someone will need to prepare an adventure. They will be called the Dungeon Master and will be both the main story teller and 
referee for the game. You can find premade adventures online or you can craft your own adventure </li>
<li>Gather your friends together</li>
<li>Everyone other than the Dungeon Master will have to make a character. There are rules for how to do so in the Player's Handbook and 
this online Character Creator can help (still under construction). </h1>
<li>Play the Game!</li>
